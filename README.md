> **Abstract:** *International Classification of Disease (ICD) coding procedure which refers to tagging medical notes with diagnosis codes has been shown to be effective and crucial to the billing system in medical sector. Currently, ICD codes are assigned to a note manually which is likely to cause many errors. Moreover, training skilled coders also requires time and human resources. Therefore, automating the determination of ICD codes is an important task. With the advancement of artificial intelligence theory and computational hardware, machine learning approach has emerged as a suitable solution to automate this process. In this project, we apply a transformer-based architecture to capture the interdependence among the tokens of a document and then use a code-wise attention mechanism to learn code-specific representations of the entire document. Finally, they are fed to separate dense layers for corresponding code prediction. Furthermore, to handle the imbalance in the code frequency of clinical datasets, we employ a label distribution aware margin (LDAM) loss function. The experimental results on the MIMIC-III dataset show that our proposed model outperforms other baselines by a significant margin. In particular, our best setting achieves a micro-AUC score of 0.923 compared to 0.868 of bidirectional recurrent neural network. We also show that by using code-wise attention mechanism, our proposed model can provide more insights about its prediction, and thus it can support clinicians to make reliable decisions.*

# Framework 

TransICD takes patients' discharge note from hospital as input, computes hidden representation of its tokens' using transformer encoder, then use code-wise attention to project entire note to latent space and finally use dense layer to predicts ICD codes associated to the note as output.
